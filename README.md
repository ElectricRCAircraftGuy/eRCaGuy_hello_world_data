# eRCaGuy_hello_world_data

Data, such as CSV files for generating plots, for my [eRCaGuy_hello_world](https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_hello_world) project. 

This is a separate repository because the data would otherwise take up hundreds of megabytes in the **eRCaGuy_hello_world** project which I'd like to keep small and easy to download, and not everyone needs this data.

# Instructions

1. When you download or clone this repo, place it at the exact same level as the **eRCaGuy_hello_world** folder. 
    - The data in this **eRCaGuy_hello_world_data** repo will then _automatically be used_ by the **eRCaGuy_hello_world** repo, because the **eRCaGuy_hello_world** repo will know the **eRCaGuy_hello_world_data** repo's relative path and location to it, and access it as needed. 
    - This relative-location setup of two distinct repos is in lieu of using [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
